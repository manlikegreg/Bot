You are an expert quantitative trading analyst and Python developer.

Your task is to build a **pure Python breakout scalping signal bot** (no GPT or MT5) that:

1. Runs every 10 minutes and analyzes the following top 5 assets:
   - BTC/USD  
   - ETH/USD  
   - XAU/USD (Gold)  
   - EUR/USD  
   - XRP/USD  

2. For each asset, fetch live data from **multiple trusted APIs** like:
   - CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap (for crypto prices)
   - Alpha Vantage, TwelveData, or ForexAPI (for Gold, EUR/USD, etc.)
   - TradingView (if possible, via unofficial or scraping for public indicators)
   - Sentiment or volume APIs (if available)
   - Optionally, calculate your own indicators like:
     - RSI (14)
     - MACD
     - Bollinger Bands
     - 50/200 MA crossover
     - Volume spikes

3. From each data source or calculated indicator:
   - Generate a **BUY**, **SELL**, or **HOLD** signal
   - Assign each a confidence score from 0% to 100%

4. For each asset:
   - Average all signalsâ€™ confidence scores
   - Decide final consensus signal:
     * If average confidence â‰¥80% and mostly BUY â†’ signal is **BUY**
     * If average confidence â‰¥80% and mostly SELL â†’ signal is **SELL**
     * Else â†’ no signal

5. Send signal alerts to Telegram via:
   - Bot Token: `7260596079:AAHBHvXe-mskrRGCBGDNCeB1CeLAvM3dhQY`
   - Chat ID: `6534876476`

6. Message format should be:

ðŸ“Š Strong Signal Alert  
Pair: ETH/USD  
Signal: BUY  
Entry: $3,150.00  
SL: $3,120.00  
TP: $3,210.00  
Timeframe: 15min to 1hr  
Confidence: 82%  
Reason: RSI bounce + MACD crossover + strong volume spike.

7. The bot must:
   - Run every 10 minutes (using `schedule` or `asyncio`)
   - Include error handling (API failures, timeouts, etc.)
   - Log data and alerts sent
   - Be optimized for running on a VPS or Android Linux terminal

---

âœ… This bot does not use OpenAI or GPT.  
âœ… It does not place real trades.  
âœ… Itâ€™s focused on **generating strong, accurate scalping signals** based on real data and logic.  
âœ… Fully Python-based.

Would you like me to now **build the code step-by-step** for this setup?

It would include:
- Real-time data fetchers (CoinGecko, Alpha Vantage, etc.)
- Technical indicator calculations
- Confidence scoring + signal aggregator
- Telegram alert system
- Scheduler (every 10 minutes)

Let me know if you're ready to begin!
